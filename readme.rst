Installation
------------

Copy the entire ``xilinx`` directory into a directory
``<scons-root>/site_scons/site_tools``, where ``<scons-root>`` must be
visible to SCons when invoked.

By default, SCons accepts the following locations as ``<scons-root>``:

- the current working directory
- ``~/.scons`` (single-user only)
- ``/usr/share/scons`` (system wide)

The file copying is handled for you if you call

::

    scons install [--user]

where the presence of the ``--user`` option selects between the
``~/.scons`` and the ``/usr/share/scons`` location.
